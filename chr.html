<br><br>
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> ICA is a Catholic educational institution for girls that provides BASIC EDUCATION, with a distinct CHINESE FILIPINO character.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> As a CATHOLIC SCHOOL, it offers an educational program which is guided by Catholic doctrines, traditions, and practices. Student formation is Catholic in orientation, rooted in Gospel values. Foremost among ICAâ€™s goals is to cultivate and nurture in the students, as well as in the faculty and
staff, a lively faith in Jesus Christ. As TRUE CHRISTIANS, they endeavor to build a community of faith that celebrates the Eucharist and other sacraments and promotes the ideal of service to others, especially the poor and marginalized.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> Its BASIC EDUCATION program is geared towards the development of COMPETENT STUDENTS who possess the necessary skills, attitudes, and
values of life-long learners. Imbued with a sense of excellence, they are driven to maximize their potentials to succeed in their chosen endeavors.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> It is a FILIPINO SCHOOL which aims to develop a strong sense of nationalism in the students that leads them to be COMMITTED CITIZENS who are appreciative of their Filipino cultural heritage, loyal to the Filipino nation, and actively involved in building a society where God reigns.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> Owing to the distinct heritage of its students, ICA aims to foster in them an appreciation of their Chinese cultural traditions and help them blend these with Filipino traditions.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> With the Blessed Mother as its patroness, ICA strives to develop in the students the tender yet firm disposition and the joyful and grateful attitude of Mary towards all that she has received. The CULTURED AND REFINED ICAn exhibits preference for the good, true, and beautiful and manifests humility about the gifts she possesses and generously shares these with others. She promotes simplicity, harmony, and peace in her family and community.
