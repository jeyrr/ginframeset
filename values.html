<center>CORE VALUES
<br><br>
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> We bear the name of Mary, the Immaculate Conception, so we look up to her, as our model of a “woman of faith, excellence, and service”, especially as shown in her Ecce-Fiat-Magnificat.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> As a woman of Faith, an ICAn has a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and lives to be Christ to others.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> As a woman of Excellence, an ICAn does all things well to be the best version of herself for God and society.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> As a woman of Service, an ICAn takes action to bring about social transformation and development.
