<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> ICA is a Catholic educational institution established by the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Conception (M.I.C.) in 1936. The school community, with a distinct Chinese Filipino character is rooted in Jesus Christ and inspired by Mary’s example of discipleship and Venerable Délia Tétreault’s spirituality of thanksgiving.
