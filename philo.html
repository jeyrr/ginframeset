<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> ICA Believes that...
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> God is our loving Father/Mother, the source of all that we are and all that we have.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> Every person, being an image of God, is endowed with potentials and powers especially the capacity to seek the truth and love the good.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> A person who is grateful for his/her gifts nurtures and shares these for the well-being of others; the greatest of these gifts is Jesus Christ â€“ the Good News Himself.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> As a steward of creation, every person respects, develops and uses creation as God intended it.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> Education is the process that leads every person towards his/her integral development which can best be realized in an open and trusting Christian community.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> Mary, our Immaculate Mother, is the model of faith, excellence, and service.
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> The school seal signifies the core values that aims to achieve for learners.
